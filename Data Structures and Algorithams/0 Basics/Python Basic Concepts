1. What is Python.
--> Python is Objected oriented program language(in which everything treated as object) it will supports for the
    Functional programing and Procedural programing.
--> Python is general purpose programing language which means we can use if for the web development, app development,
    game development, data science, machine learning..etc
--> Python is an dynamically typed language where we dont declare object data type python interpreter will
    capability to understand which data type it is.
--> Python primerly consider it as the interpreted language. This means code executed line by line. How ever initially
    Python will compiled code into byte code (Interpreter) .pyc files and then Interpreted ( Python virtual machine)  and give results.

2. Memory management in python.
--> Python mainly 3 main parts.
    i. Python Stack memory : Stack memory is responsible for the storing object reference variable and order of method execution.
       It will take care mainly execution related things.
    ii. Python Heap memory : All the actual objects are store in the heap memory.
        --> Ex : a = 5 --> a will be stored in stack and value 5 will be stored in heap memory.
    iii. Garbage collector : In Python Garbage collection done automatically based on the reference count and cycle count.
         we can call garbage collector manually as well for better performance tuning using gc module.

3. How objects will work.
--> Once Object got created in python, In python we will call variables also objects. Object is referred by the some variable
    Suppose a = 15, a will stored in the stack memory and 15 will be stored in the heap memory. if again we will create
    one more variable called b = 15 , in this condition it wont create any extra space in heap memory b variable got created
    in stack it will referred the same object. Which means memory address of the a and b are same and simply 15 object
    reference count increased to 2 because now a, b two variables pointing to the same object.

4. What are all mutable and immutable objects in Python.
--> Mutable objects : Mutable objects are the objects after the object creation we can perform some operations like adding elements
    like that there memory address will remain same.
    Ex : List, Set, Dictionary.
--> Immutable objects : Immutable objects won't support any operations after the object once got created. even we have
    special methods to perform operation on immutable objects there memory address is going to change if you perform like concatenation.
    Ex : Tuple, String, Int
