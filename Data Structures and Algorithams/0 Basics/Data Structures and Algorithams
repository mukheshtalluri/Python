Data structure : Data structures are the different ways of organising the data that can be used efficiently.
Algorithm : Algorithm are set of steps which can accomplish the task.

Types of data structure:
--> Primitive :
    --> Integer
    --> Float
    --> Character
    --> Boolean
    --> String
--> Non - primitive :
    --> Linear:
        --> Static :
            --> Array
        --> Dynamic :
            --> Linked list
            --> Stack
            --> Queue
    --> Non - Linear :
        --> Graph
        --> Tree

Types of algorithm:
1. Simple recursive algorithm.
2. Divide and conquer algorithm.
3. Dynamic programing.
4. Greedy algorithm.
5. Brute force algorithm.
6. Randomised algorithm.
