Recursion : A way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.
            - Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
            - In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
            - Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.

    if exit from condition if it is satisfied:
        return some value
